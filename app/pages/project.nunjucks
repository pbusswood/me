        In 2015, I founded ChangeHack, a non-profit focused on bringing together a diverse group of people to develop creative solutions to some of the most important problems facing our society.

        I co-founded LDRLY, a game services startup focused on creating a player intelligence platform that helps game developers improve retention, engagement, and monetization. As Chief Creative Officer, I led design and later operations for the company, managing a team of designers and software engineers and coordinating product strategy. I've also worked at East Side Games leading product and design for their analytics and core tech teams.

        In the tech community, I have organized TEDx, Startup Weekend and Google Developer Group events. I have also co-founded two non-profit organizations, including ChangeHack, which aims to bring together diverse groups of people to solve important social problems.

        In my spare time, I run, play soccer, curl, read, play games on my PS4, and spend time with friends. Iâ€™m always keeping tabs on tech industry news, listening to gaming podcasts, attending local meetups, and I often travel to tech and game industry conferences.
