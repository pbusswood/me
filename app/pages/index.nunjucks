        Hey, I'm Parker! I'm deeply passionate about startups, entrepreneurship, design, technology, gaming, and creating fantastic user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I co-founded LDRLY, a game services startup focused on creating a player intelligence platform that helps game developers improve retention, engagement, and monetization. As Chief Creative Officer, I led design and later operations for the company, managing a team of designers and software engineers and coordinating product strategy. I've also worked at East Side Games leading product and design for their analytics and core tech teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the tech community, I have organized TEDx, Startup Weekend and Google Developer Group events. I have also co-founded two non-profit organizations, including ChangeHack, which aims to bring together diverse groups of people to solve important social problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I run, play soccer, curl, read, play games on my PS4, and spend time with friends. Iâ€™m always keeping tabs on tech industry news, listening to gaming podcasts, attending local meetups, and I often travel to tech and game industry conferences.
